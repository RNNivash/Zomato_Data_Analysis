# Zomato Data Analysis

Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis project! This Python-based project leverages popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform in-depth analysis on restaurant data sourced from Zomato. The primary datasets used in this project are `customer.csv` and `orders.csv`, which contain valuable insights into customer preferences and order trends.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and analysis, including DataFrame operations and data type conversions.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating visualizations such as line graphs, pie charts, and bar charts to present data clearly.

## Datasets

1. **customer.csv**: Contains information about customers, including demographics and preferences.
2. **orders.csv**: Records details about orders, including timestamps, items ordered, and total spend.

## Installation

To get started with this project, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Use

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Explore the Datasets**: Open the `customer.csv` and `orders.csv` files to understand the structure and contents of the data.

3. **Run the Analysis**: Open a Python environment and execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

4. **Visualize the Results**: The analysis will produce various visualizations, including:
   - **Line Graphs**: To track trends over time.
   - **Pie Charts**: To display proportions of different categories.
   - **Bar Charts**: To compare quantities across different groups.
